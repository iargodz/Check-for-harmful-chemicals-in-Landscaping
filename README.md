# Check-for-harmful-chemicals-in-Landscaping
Auto detection of an advice that may not be universally legal or safe (e.g., glue traps, restricted chemicals). Goal is to protect users so they don't get an advice that can damage their or anyone's health and may be braking regional laws. Auto comment to consider adding disclaimers or offering safer alternatives
I thought it was a standard Reddit filter. Iâ€™m modding a sub and trying to keep advice useful and safe across different regions. For example, someone might recommend glue traps, which are illegal in many places (small birds and endangered wildlife gets caught), or some chemical for getting rid of some plants, but that can be banned somewhere. If people globally read and were to follow such an advice - in many regions it can cause issues with local authorities and can cause permanent health problems to people, animals, ecosystem and stay in the soil really long time. Ususally if its known to be toxic there is a good chance its banned somewhere. So this is an example of Auto moderator of Reddit rule that checks for possibly harmful advice and generates a friendly reminder comment like "this may be banned and harmful, consider smth safer".
