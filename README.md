# Check-for-harmful-chemicals-in-Landscaping

I thought it was a standard filter on social platforms, but apparently no. 

This might help to automatically moderate and filter social media, where people sometimes suggest something that works and is legal in their area without considering the fact that this may be read and adopted worldwide and may cause issues. This exact rule is for Reddit automoderator but can be adopted to other platforms, goal is to keep advice useful and safe across different regions. For example, someone might recommend glue traps, which are illegal in many places (small birds and endangered wildlife gets caught, in some regions can be considered inhumane treatment of animals), or some chemical for getting rid of some plants thats banned somewhere. If people globally read and were to follow such an advice - in many regions it can cause issues with local authorities and can cause permanent health problems to people, animals, ecosystem and stay in the soil really long time. Ususally if its known to be toxic there is a good chance its banned somewhere. So this is an example of Auto moderator rule for Reddit that checks for possibly harmful advice and generates a friendly reminder comment like "this may be banned and harmful, consider smth safer". Can be modified to fit other sites too.
